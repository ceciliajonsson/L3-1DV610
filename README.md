## 1. Get Started - User & Developer

### Get Started - User

The Text Checker App has not yet launched on the web - stay tuned!

### Get Started - Developer

To contribute to the Text Checker module please check the README.md file in [L2-1DV610](https://github.com/ceciliajonsson/L2-1DV610).

git clone [https://github.com/ceciliajonsson/L3-1DV610]
```

Navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies.

```
cd text-checker-app
npm install
```

Run the script to start the development enviroment.

```
npm run dev
```

## 2. Purpose & Vision

The Text Checker App is designed to empower users by providing a comprehensive set of tools that can analyze and manipulate text input.

By extracting data and valuable information from the text, users can gain valuable insights and ensure that the text meets the standards set by the author, whether it's a novel or an academic paper.

## 3. Target Audience

- Writers: To identify overused words or manipulate text.
- Educators and Students: For analyzing word count in essays and assignments.
- Content Creators: To optimize and manipulate text content.

## 4. Future Enhancements

- Understand the tone and sentiment of the text.
- Povide a score based on how easy the text is to understand.
- Grammar and Spelling Check.

## 5. Functional & Non-functional Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Fundamental actions or processes that the app must be able to perform.

- Text Validation: Ensure that the input text meets certain criteria before processing.
- Text Analytics: Count characters, words, sentences, vowels, and much more.
- Text Averages: Get average word length, sentence length, etc.
- Text Frequency: Identify most used letters, words, symbols, numbers, and even pronouns.
- Text Manipulation: Replace words, symbols, numbers or even reverse text and sentences.

### Non-functional Requirements

Desired characteristics and behaviors that do not relate directly to its functional behavior.

- Usability: The UI must be user-friendly and intuitive, even for non-technical users.
- Security: It shouldn't be possible to post scripts.
- Performance: The app should analyze and process the text within a few seconds.

## 6. Testing

The application has been tested with manual testing. The test rapport is avilable in the testrapport.md file.
The module has been tested with automatic tests. The tests used are avilable in the test folder.

## 7. Module and app dependency

The app is dependent on the module, but the module is not dependent on the app. The code for the module and it's tests was added directly to the repository of the Test Checker App.

While working on the app, a number of bugs and limitations were discovered and were carefully documented from the start in the issue-log-text-checker.md.

Continuesly updating the module code while documenting the limitation and changes allowed me to continue the development of the app while keeping track of the changes to ensure that any modifications to the module's code would later be updated in the resportity of the actual module [https://github.com/ceciliajonsson/L2-1DV610] to improve it's functionality.
